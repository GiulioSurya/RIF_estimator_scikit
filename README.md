RIF_estimator_scikit is a modular, scikit-learn-compatible implementation of a contextual anomaly detection framework.
It combines regression-based residual computation with Isolation Forest to detect behavioral anomalies relative to environmental context.
The model supports out-of-bag (OOB) and k-fold strategies for leakage-free residual estimation, and integrates Bayesian optimization for model tuning.
